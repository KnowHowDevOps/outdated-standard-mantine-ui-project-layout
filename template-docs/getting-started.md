# 🚀 Getting Started Guide

Welcome to your new React 19 project! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed:

- [Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (fast, disk space efficient package manager)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Start Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Your app will be running at `http://localhost:5173` 🎉

### 3. Start Building Features

The project uses **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)** architecture. Here's how to add your first feature:

```bash
# Create a new feature
mkdir -p src/features/my-feature/{model,ui,api}
touch src/features/my-feature/index.ts
```

## 🏗️ Project Structure

```
