## [Unreleased]

### 🏗️ **Major Architecture Refactor - Feature-Sliced Design Implementation**

#### Added

- **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) Architecture**
  - Complete project restructure following FSD methodology
  - Clear layer separation: App → Processes → Pages → Features → Entities → Shared
  - Public API pattern with barrel files for all slices
  - Proper import hierarchy enforcement

- **Enhanced Data Layer**
  - Entity-specific queries for pure data access
  - Feature-specific queries with business logic and validation
  - Process-level queries for cross-entity workflows
  - Proper cache invalidation strategies per layer

- **Validation System**
  - Zod validation schemas for all user inputs
  - Runtime type validation with error messages
  - Form validation integration with React Hook Form
  - Entity-level and feature-level validation patterns

- **Zustand State Management Integration**
  - Hybrid state management: Tanstack Query for server state, Zustand for client state
  - FSD-compliant store organization across layers
  - Automatic persistence for important state (auth session, user preferences)
  - Integration hooks connecting Zustand stores with Tanstack Query
  - UI state management (theme, modals, notifications, loading)
  - Form state management with auto-save and validation
  - Development tools and debugging utilities

- **Routing Architecture**
  - Consolidated routing in pages layer
  - File-based routing with Tanstack Router
  - Route definitions co-located with page components
  - Type-safe routing with auto-generated route tree

- **Process Layer Implementation**
  - Cross-entity authentication session management
  - User onboarding workflow coordination
  - Complex business process orchestration

#### Changed

- **Project Structure**
  - Migrated from traditional folder structure to FSD layers
  - Separated business logic from UI components
  - Created clear boundaries between features and entities
  - Implemented proper encapsulation with public APIs

- **Query Organization**
  - Moved basic CRUD operations to entities layer
  - Elevated business logic to features layer
  - Created process-level coordination for complex workflows
  - Improved cache management with layer-specific strategies

- **Import Patterns**
  - Enforced public API usage across all layers
  - Eliminated deep imports that bypass encapsulation
  - Standardized import paths with clear hierarchy
  - Improved maintainability with consistent patterns

- **Validation Architecture**
  - Moved validation schemas from entities to features
  - Created feature-specific validation with business rules
  - Implemented form validation patterns
  - Added runtime type safety with Zod integration

#### Improved

- **Developer Experience**
  - Clear architectural guidelines and documentation
  - Predictable code organization and patterns
  - Improved type safety throughout the application
  - Better separation of concerns for team collaboration

- **Maintainability**
  - Reduced coupling between application layers
  - Improved testability with isolated business logic
  - Enhanced scalability with clear architectural boundaries
  - Better code reusability across features

- **Performance**
  - Optimized query invalidation strategies
  - Improved cache management per architectural layer
  - Better code splitting with clear feature boundaries
  - Enhanced bundle optimization with proper imports

#### Documentation

- **Architecture Guides**
  - [fsd-architecture.md](FSD_ARCHITECTURE.md) - Complete architecture overview
  - [public-api-enforcement.md](PUBLIC_API_ENFORCEMENT.md) - API patterns and rules
  - [validation-guide.md](VALIDATION_GUIDE.md) - Zod validation patterns
  - [final-fsd-summary.md](FINAL_FSD_SUMMARY.md) - Implementation summary

- **Updated README.md**
  - Added FSD architecture section
  - Updated project structure documentation
  - Enhanced feature descriptions with architectural context
  - Added layer responsibility matrix

### Technical Details

#### Layer Implementation

- **App Layer**: Application initialization, global providers, router configuration
- **Processes Layer**: Authentication session management, user onboarding workflows
- **Pages Layer**: Route definitions, page composition, layout management
- **Features Layer**: Business logic, validation, feature-specific UI components
- **Entities Layer**: Pure data access, basic UI components, entity types
- **Shared Layer**: Utilities, base API, common types, reusable UI components

#### Query Architecture

- **Entity Queries**: Pure CRUD operations without business logic
- **Feature Queries**: Business logic composition with validation
- **Process Queries**: Cross-entity coordination and complex workflows
- **Proper Cache Management**: Layer-specific invalidation strategies

#### Validation System

- **Schemas**: User registration, login, profile updates, admin operations
- **Runtime Validation**: Zod integration with React Hook Form
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety from validation to API calls
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and validation feedback

#### Public API Pattern

- **Barrel Files**: Every slice exposes functionality through index.ts
- **Encapsulation**: Internal implementation details hidden from consumers
- **Import Rules**: Strict hierarchy enforcement with clear boundaries
- **Maintainability**: Easy refactoring without breaking consumer code
